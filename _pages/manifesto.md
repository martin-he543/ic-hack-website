### Our Policies
---
We will endeavour to make the Physics department less cringe.

1. **Our main policy is to wage a war against clicking "Reply-All" on an e-mail.** Whether this be declining attendance for a Fourier Office Hour in the middle of the Easter Holidays, or replying to a professor asking for your ranking in the year, we promise to do our best to put an end to this insanity. Those who fail to comply, where the reply-all is universally deemed as unnecessary will be informed that this is not common e-mail etiquette *(I know how to speak Chinese so I can do this in both English and Mandarin).*

2. **Creation of a weekly e-mail update in Blackett to cure departmental depression** by providing an update on what Stuart Mangles had for breakfast. Also in this e-mail (though less important), will be information obtained from LinkedIn, Indeed, among other sources with possible internship roles you can apply to which are looking for a Physics skillset, as well as careers events, things going on in London, a weekly crowdsourced book recommendation, place to visit in London, as well as a group Spotify playlist for Blackett. This e-mail will be provided in Chinese as well.

3. **Add a suggestion box to Blackett** because there's no better way to improve the department than hearing directly from its students. This will also take a digital form, as well as a physical one, because populism and democracy is the best combination.

4. **Make Blackett Level 3 water as good as Level 2 water.** This is a very urgent issue, and we promise that it is at the top of the agenda.

5. **Increasing support and outreach.** Increase support for LGBTQ+ students (open to suggestions) as well as increasing outreach with other London Physics departments, in particular with UCL.

6. **Weekly movie screenings at Blackett.** What better way to relax after a bunch of tiring lectures than a movie in LT1 (we will check, subject to timetabling when this will take place). We promise to bake chocolate chip cookies as well at some point. This will help to increase socialising outside your quarter of the year.

7. **Start a competition for who can hold the longest plank.** Hold an annual competition in Blackett for who can hold the longest plank, with a cash prize.

8. **Miscellaneous academic issues.** As with any rep running for office, we will attempt to amend anywhere which we think is stupid or unfair with the running of the course, whether this be deadline dates, marking procedures, late feedback, etc. With the creation of the suggestion box, you will be able to suggest what exactly. We will also make sure any surveys are as short and to-the-point as possible.
