<!-- <a class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="1s">Other than academic stuff, I am a decent pianist, and working on self-composing various pieces (piano and otherwise), primarily in the neo-Classical style, though I tend to disregard genres for the most part. I also work on piano arrangements if I have any spare time, and music production in Logic Pro X (or Ableton Live). Please follow me on Strava if you like MTB or running and shit. Follow me on Instagram for personal schenanigans.</a> -->
