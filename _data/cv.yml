- title: Miscellaneous Interests
  type: list
  contents:
    - <b>Piano</b> - Grade 8 Distinction, Grade 5 Music Theory. I am currently learning Chopin's Heroïque, and an arrangement of Unravel, Tokyo Ghoul by Animenz, with drums played by my friend, Harry.
    - <b>Cycling</b> - I often can be found in the Surrey Hills, mostly exploring different routes through various forested tracks, or quiet single-track roads, such as the ones around Westhumble or <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/628859?hl=en-GB">Shere</a>. A long-time ambition of mine has been to cycle from London to Paris (via. <a href="https://london2paris.co.uk/routes/3-day-cycle-routes/">Newhaven</a>).
    - <b>Table Tennis</b> - I am pretty mediocre at playing the sport, however, I am left-handed and pen-hold which throws some people off. I can be found playing weekly at my local congregation.
    - <b>Japanese</b> - I am currently self-learning Japanese. My current ability is sufficient to just about read most of a newspaper, however, I endeavour to take the JLPT N4 and N3 in the near-future.
