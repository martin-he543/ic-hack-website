I neither disagree with the statement that Yahweh is a good and just god. 

On the other hand, Yahweh’s punishments can be interpreted as too extreme. A salvation cycle has occurred about 3 times in Jewish history. Once withThe Holocaust that resulted in the deaths of 6 million Jews and the Assyrian Destruction which wiped out 10 of the tribes can be seen too harsh for a god that is ‘always there for you’ and ‘omnibenevolent. ‘If he really is all loving, then why would he need to send people into such turmoil and agony, why does he send them to eternal pain in hell? Does this mean that his punishments aren’t really appropriate? If so, does this simply mean Yahweh enjoys seeing people suffer: is he as Richard Dawkins said, “a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.” 

However, other people interpret Yahweh as a good and just god, as many Jews would agree. They would argue that the b’rit and salvation cycle is evident throughout the Old Testament: in the book of Exodus, Yahweh liberates the Jews from slavery, punishing their Egyptian captors for generations of unjust. In the book Kings 1:11:11-13, King Solomon was a wise and powerful man - he even built a temple in his palace. However, his obsession with collecting wives, mostly non-Hebrew, resulted in Yahweh splitting up his kingdom for breaking the 7th and 1st Divine commandments. Adam and Eve’s wrong judgment resulted in their banishment from paradise. Someone doesn’t put the effort into preventing themselves into doing something until they know what consequences may arise from this. This can be said to justify his actions by preventing people into doing things that he may construe as ‘stupid.’ Yahweh will not follow his obligations if the people don’t follow theirs. 

Overall, I have a split opinion over whether God is fair or just. This is because I think if he really loves his people, he should teach his people their obligations. However, some punishments may be a little over the top (i.e. the Holocaust) in which rather than achieving his purpose of teaching his people, he is effectively ‘bullying’ his people with the horrors of those situations.
