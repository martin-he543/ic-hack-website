I think the cosmological argument is clearly not a sound argument. There are several factors that influence my opinion. 

Firstly, to make this argument sound, all the premises must be true. But when we look at the cosmological argument, this is clearly not the case. Many of the premises are questionable or false, meaning that the cosmological argument still remains irresolute. 

Premise 3, for instance, states that “there must be a first cause because an infinite number of causes are impossible”. This is still highly questionable because infinite regression can still be possible as there is a theory of a Big Bang occurring and then a Big Crunch and then a Big Bang and so on and so on therefore being no first cause. However, other philosophers like Thomas Aquinas have argued that if everything has a cause, then the universe also must have a cause as well, saying there cannot be an infinite number of causes as something like that would be impossible. Therefore, something must have caused it as a beginning or a First Cause and we call it God. The thing is, in the past, we have previously made many mistakes, in that in the past we couldn’t imagine the world being round, and we never thought atoms existed, but that the Earth was made of four elements. And now as the question looms of whether the universe is caused or uncaused, we cannot really imagine something not having a cause, but in the future, further understanding may help us figure out this.  

Premise 6 is another questionable premise. It goes “this being itself would not come into existence.” This question is the one that confuses me the most. This is mainly because of the question of, if this omnipotent being created us, what created it? Now if the universe had a cause, then what caused it? If it goes on forever, as in God is eternal and uncaused, how was he made and how did he make us? This question is highly questionable and unknown as there is no evidence apart from religious scriptures. 

There are many cosmological theories, which include the two main cosmological theories of Biblical cosmology and the Big Bang theory. Hindu cosmology is about an oscillating universe in which one cycle of a universe is around 8 billion years. It consists of an infinite number of years following and an infinite number of years behind. The oscillating universe theory is similar apart from there is a Big Bang and a Big Crunch. 

There are many theories out there on what started the universe or if it’s oscillating. But no matter whatever theory, the argument for sure isn’t sound as many premises still remain unknown and questionable, and considering premise 2 that states that “the universe exists”, where there are many more theories that disprove or prove this. There are so many premises unanswered that I can confirm that the Cosmological Argument is unsound.
