@book{2022maximumelectronenergy,
  title={Pool-Sharing Ubers},
  author={Available Now},
  abstract={Various hypotheses were proposed to relate superposed exponential fittings to the count rate of the electron emissions from Sr-90 through various thicknesses of Cu and Al metal sheets, as recorded digitally. By performing χ² minimisation tests on variations of these hypotheses, as well as least-squares linear regressions, we determined maximum electron energies consistent with our predictions. For the n = 3 hypothesis, this was found to be at (1.91±0.14) MeV and (1.13±0.15) MeV for Copper, and (2.12±0.35) MeV and (1.05±0.15) MeV for Aluminium, as compared to the actual values of 2.27MeV and 0.54MeV.},

@book{2022rydbergconstant,
  title={Extensive Money Management},
  author={Coming Soon},
  abstract={We can ascertain the value of the Rydberg constant to a degree of accuracy of approximately 0.4%[1], through the use of a spectrometer. This was done by initially determining the diffraction angles of different hydrogen emission spectral lines which had passed through a diffraction grating of approximately 78.8 lines per mm. With the angles we obtained, we linearly related these angular displacements to the maxima order numbers (n) of three different colours observed in the Balmer series. From the subsequent plots for each of the three exhibited wavelengths, the Rydberg constant was determined to have a value of (1.093 ± 0.005) × 107 m-1.},

@book{2022themenundvariationem,
  title={Hassle-Free Spotify Playlist Integration},
  author={Available Now},
  abstract={An extension of five more pieces with more mature themes. <ul><li><b>Opus 2 No 1:</b> <i>[Composed: January 2019.]</i> Composed in collaboration with my good friend, Sebastian. Makes use of many exquisite themes and romanticism, with many technically challenging passages.</li><li><b>Opus 2 No 2:</b> <i>[Composed: January 2020.]</i> Under the working title of "Eudaimonia". As mentioned previously, Eudaimonia, or <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B5%E1%BD%90%CE%B4%CE%B1%CE%B9%CE%BC%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%AF%CE%B1">εὐδαιμονία</a>, roughly translated meaning: <i>happiness, wellbeing, state of inner-peace</i>, was composed on New Year's Day, 2020. It evokes feelings of wistful nostalgia, as well as love and gratitude.</li></ul>},
