  title={Reducing Food Waste and Carbon Emissions},
  author={Available Only In Milan},
  abstract={Our Houseparty organising app is not just a tool for organizing a great party, it's also a tool for reducing food waste and offsetting carbon emissions. Our app's comprehensive money pooling functionality helps to reduce food waste by allowing guests to pool their funds in advance, so that the host can purchase the exact amount of food and drinks needed for the party. This means that there will be no excess food or drinks left over, reducing waste and saving resources.<br /><br />In addition to reducing food waste, our app also helps to offset carbon emissions through its carpooling functionality. By encouraging guests to share rides to and from the party, we can reduce the number of cars on the road, and thus the amount of carbon emissions produced.<br /><br />To further emphasize the positive impact that our app has on the environment, we display an estimation of how many trees and emissions were saved as a percentage of otherwise. This allows guests to see the tangible benefits of their actions, and encourages them to continue making environmentally conscious choices in the future.},

@book{2023allergyrequirements,
  title={Allergy and Dietary Requirements},
  author={Available Only In Germany},
  abstract={The Pret allergy death was a tragic event that occurred in 2016, when a customer with a severe sesame allergy suffered a fatal reaction after eating a Pret A Manger sandwich that was mislabeled as being free of sesame. This event shook the foundations of British society and sparked a nationwide conversation about food allergies and the need for better information sharing.<br /><br />In the wake of the tragedy, significant reforms were introduced to improve the way that allergy information is shared and communicated. Food retailers were required to provide clear and accurate information about the ingredients in their products, and restaurants and cafes were encouraged to offer allergen-free options for customers with special dietary needs.<br /><br />Our Houseparty organising app builds on this legacy by incorporating comprehensive allergy information sharing into its core functionality. With our app, guests can specify their dietary needs and requirements, and hosts can easily track and manage this information to ensure that everyone is able to enjoy the food and drinks provided.<br /><br />In addition to this, our app also allows for easy communication between guests and hosts, so that any questions or concerns about allergies can be addressed in real-time. This means that everyone can feel confident and comfortable at the party, knowing that their dietary needs have been taken into consideration.},

@book{2023poolsharingubers,
  title={Pool-Sharing Ubers},
  author={Available Worldwide},
  abstract={Our Houseparty organising app is the ultimate tool for organizing a stress-free party, and our comprehensive Uber pooling functionality is one of its standout features. With this feature, you can pool with friends and guests who are travelling to and from the party, making it easier and more cost-effective to get everyone where they need to be.<br /><br />One of the most exciting aspects of our Uber pooling functionality is the ability to pool with people you like. This means that you can choose to share a ride with friends who you know and trust, making the experience more enjoyable and personal.<br /><br />In addition to this, our app integrates health data to use fun metrics such as heart rate or cortisol levels to determine who gets the ride first. This is a unique and innovative feature that takes the guesswork out of deciding who should get the ride, and makes the experience even more enjoyable for everyone involved.<br /><br />To make the Uber pooling process as seamless as possible, we've also built a travelling salesman optimization algorithm using the Google Maps API. This algorithm finds the most suitable route for everyone, taking into account the locations of each person and the shortest distance between them. This means that you can be sure that everyone will get to their destination in the quickest and most efficient way possible.},

@book{2023comprehensivemoneymanagement,
  title={Comprehensive Money Management},
  author={Now Testing Beta Version},
  abstract={Our Houseparty organising app is designed to make throwing a party as easy and stress-free as possible. One of the most important aspects of any party is managing the money and ensuring that everyone is on the same page. That's why we've created comprehensive money management functions to help make the process simple and seamless.<br /><br />With our app, you can pool money for various expenses like alcohol, Ubers, food, and drinks. This makes it easier to split the cost between all the guests and avoid any awkward conversations about money later on. You can also set a budget for the party and track expenses in real-time, so you always know exactly how much you've spent.<br /><br />One of the most unique features of our app is the ability to cater for dietary requirements. You can specify the dietary needs of each guest and make sure that everyone is able to enjoy the food and drinks that are provided. This feature is particularly useful for those with allergies, food sensitivities, or special dietary requirements.<br /><br />In addition to these features, our app also allows you to create money pools based on specific groups. For example, if you want to pool money with a group of friends who are all sharing an Uber to the party, you can easily create a separate money pool just for that. This makes it easier to keep track of expenses and ensure that everyone is contributing fairly.<br /><br />In conclusion, our Houseparty organising app is the perfect solution for anyone looking to throw a stress-free party. With comprehensive money management functions, the ability to cater for dietary requirements, and the option to create money pools based on specific groups, you'll have everything you need to make your party a success.},

  title={A Failed Houseparty - A Beginning},
  author={How It All Began...},
  abstract={Once upon a time, there was a group of friends who decided to throw a house party in one of their friend's basement in Acton Town. The host, Tom, was excited to show off his new place and spend a night filled with laughter and memories with his closest friends.<br /><br />However, Tom did not take the proper measures in planning the party. He failed to inform his neighbors about the event, and he did not provide enough drinks and snacks for everyone. As a result, guests brought their own alcohol and created a loud atmosphere that disturbed the peace in the neighborhood.<br /><br />Before long, the police arrived at the scene and raided the party. The guests scattered, and the music stopped as the police walked down the stairs to the basement. The mood quickly shifted from excitement to fear as the officers began to question everyone and check for underage drinking.<br /><br />The partygoers realized that their night of fun had turned into a disaster. They felt embarrassed and disappointed in Tom for not being a responsible host. The guests left the party one by one, and the once lively basement was left empty and quiet.<br /><br />Tom was devastated by the failed party and the consequences that came with it. He realized that he had let his friends down and damaged his relationship with his neighbors. From that day on, Tom learned the importance of proper planning and responsibility when hosting a party.<br /><br />The failed house party in Acton Town became a cautionary tale among the group of friends, reminding them of the importance of responsible decision-making and the consequences of poor planning.},
