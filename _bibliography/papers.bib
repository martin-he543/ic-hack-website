  title={Determining the Maximum Electron Energy with Sr-90, Aluminium and Copper},
  author={Ollie Sharpe, Martin A. He},
  abstract={Various hypotheses were proposed to relate superposed exponential fittings to the count rate of the electron emissions from Sr-90 through various thicknesses of Cu and Al metal sheets, as recorded digitally. By performing χ² minimisation tests on variations of these hypotheses, as well as least-squares linear regressions, we determined maximum electron energies consistent with our predictions. For the n = 3 hypothesis, this was found to be at (1.91±0.14) MeV and (1.13±0.15) MeV for Copper, and (2.12±0.35) MeV and (1.05±0.15) MeV for Aluminium, as compared to the actual values of 2.27MeV and 0.54MeV.},

@book{2022rydbergconstant,
  title={Measuring the Rydberg Constant with a Diffraction Grating},
  author={Ollie Sharpe, Martin A. He},
  abstract={We can ascertain the value of the Rydberg constant to a degree of accuracy of approximately 0.4%[1], through the use of a spectrometer. This was done by initially determining the diffraction angles of different hydrogen emission spectral lines which had passed through a diffraction grating of approximately 78.8 lines per mm. With the angles we obtained, we linearly related these angular displacements to the maxima order numbers (n) of three different colours observed in the Balmer series. From the subsequent plots for each of the three exhibited wavelengths, the Rydberg constant was determined to have a value of (1.093 ± 0.005) × 107 m-1.},

@book{2019themenundvariationem,
  title={Opus 1, Themen und Variationem},
  author={Original Composition},
  abstract={Five separate pieces exploring different themes and variations. <ul><li><b>Opus 1 No 1:</b> <i>[Composed: October 2014.]</i> Probably the first piece I ever composed in earnest for the "Rondo" brief given in Year 7 Music class. I still proudly (though misguidedly) maintain that this was the most-liked composition in my entire school's Noteflight whilst it was actively available.</li><li><b>Opus 1 No 2:</b> <i>[Composed: 2018]</i> The first, original "Interpretation and Interpolation" as it came to be known for Music class, which was rather just an enormous euphemism for ghostwriting coursework on a commission-wise basis. In this musical number, my teacher accused me of plagiarism Mozart.</li><li><b>Opus 1 No 3:</b> <i>[Composed: 2018 - 2019]</i> A miserable piece with an noticeable second variation, inspired in the style of Chopin. I had the stupid idea of embedding a triplet within a triplet, and then just ran with it. The final variation is best described as a metaphorical scream of disillusionment, ending on a hopeful tierce de picardie. I was obsessed with the ideas of hubris from Classic Mythology at the time as well as Shakespeare (i.e. Macbeth), hence the title.</li><li><b>Opus 1 No 4:</b> <i>[Composed: 2018 - 2019]</i> As the title suggest, suffering. I came up with the first variational motif in a garden shed whilst wearing a very large coat and shivering profusely.</li><li><b>Opus 1 No 5:</b> <i>[Composed: 2019]</i> A piece that was composed in under 30 minutes. Once the initial motif appeared in my head, in what can only be described as a interesting take on Chim Chim Cheree, the rest briskly followed. This piece takes a stroll exploring the relative major, before returning to the initial theme in a cyclical manner, with a wistful coda that embodies this nostalgia. As the fantastic Raya Kostava summed it up: <i>"it's sounds like you have the soul of a 70 year old French man smoking cigarettes on a balcony."</i></li></ul>},

  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
