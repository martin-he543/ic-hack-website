**WARNING:** What follows in an over-excited blog post created at midnight after trying for several hours to deploy this site onto GitHub, and after tweaking with godknows how much (S)CSS and Javascript.

<br />
And the government shall be upon his sho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ulder. And the blog shall be calleth... "95 f√¶ces". If you didn't understand the references made in this blog post, see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS3vpAWW2Zc&ab_channel=LondonSymphonyOrchestra">video</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_Part_I#12">article</a>. Disappointing. :expressionless:

Sooooooooo.... I decided to impromptu create a website, because I lost an eBay auction to a bid sniper, which got me incredibly vexxed. *It was only a bid, it was only a bid!* Nevertheless, incensed by such masteful tactics, I resolved that the only course of action to complete on an uneventful August day would be to create this website as quickly as humanely possible.

For the uncultured swine, the passage from the Bible is also listed below:

> "For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given; And the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."
> <ul>Isaiah 9:6-7</ul>
